		  <h3>HFES Student Chapter at Penn State</h3>
          <p>
           The Student Chapter of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society at the Pennsylvania State University was formed in the Fall of 1994 by students in the Human Factors area from the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. In July, 1995 the newly founded chapter was recognized by the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society as one of two new student chapters. The goal of forming this chapter was to unite Penn State students from various academic disciplines with interests in the study of human performance from physiological, cognitive, and sociological viewpoints. Because human factors is a multidisciplinary field, students from numerous areas have been involved.

            <h3>A Word from the Faculty Advisor</h3>
			<p>	 
				 Welcome to the Penn State Student Chapter of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society! It was founded in the mid 1990's because of the sharp increase in student interest in human factors and ergonomics. Typically the chapter hosts several guest speakers, one social event, and one field trip per semester. 
				 Some of the places visited have included the Bureau of Mines and its experimental coal mine in Bruceton, PA, the Human Engineering Lab with its live-fire demonstrations in Aberdeen, MD, and Taylor Packing Co. with its assembly line meat processing in Wyalusing, PA.
				 If you have any interest in human factors and ergonomics, this is an opportunity to find out more about a career in this field, to establish potential contacts in industry and to meet with fellow students with similar interests. Please contact me (axf@psu.edu) or one of the officers for more information. See you at the next meeting!
              </p>
